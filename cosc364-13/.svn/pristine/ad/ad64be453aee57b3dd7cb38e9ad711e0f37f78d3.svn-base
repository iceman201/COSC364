ROUTING DAEMON PROGRAM

STORE A ROUTING TABLE
Should contain one entry for each destination. Each entry contains:
	(ID) Destination IP Address
	First router along the route to the destination
	Metric/Cost of getting to the destination
	Route Change Flag (Boolean)
	Value of timers.
	
TIMERS
Every 30 seconds
	Send "update message" to every neighbouring router.
		This update mesage should contain the routing table, 
		EXCEPT for reverse routes.
		eg.
		if there is a route A->B->C->D, A does not tell B or C
		that it has a route to D.
If we haven't received an "update message" from router 'G'  for 180 seconds
	Start 120 second timer (Garbage Collection Timer)
	Set metric for router 'G' to 16 
	Toggle "route change" flag in routing table for router 'G'
	If we receive update message from router 'G':
		Update routing table
		Clear Garbage Collection Timer
	Send "update message"

RECEIVING UPDATE MESSAGES
Router should be able to receive messages at any point. Either using 
timer, threading or callback function.
	Analyse Message
	Update Routing Table if necessary
